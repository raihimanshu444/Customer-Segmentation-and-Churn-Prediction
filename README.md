# Customer-Segmentation-and-Churn-Prediction
Project Overview
Customer Segmentation:
Used KMeans Clustering to segment customers based on behavior and spending patterns.
Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Churn Prediction:
Used a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn.
Tuned the model with GridSearchCV for improved performance.

Technologies Used
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook for development and testing.

Dataset
The dataset contains customer features like OrderCount, CashbackAmount, and Churn (target variable). It helps predict customer behavior and churn.


Usage
Customer Segmentation: Segment customers using KMeans clustering.
Churn Prediction: Train and evaluate the churn prediction model using Random Forest.
